Please use google colab to run the project
1. First run preprocessing.py it will provide a csv file we will need to use it for all other notebooks
2. To get the results of LSTM, run lstm.py
3. To get results of BERT, run bert.py
4. To hypertune bert and get parameters, run hypertuning_bert_parameter_search.py 
5. To get results from hypertuned bert, run hypertuned_bert.py
6. To run the bert_lstm model, run bert_lstm.py
